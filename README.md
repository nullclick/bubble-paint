# bubble-paint
A match-three puzzle game where actions are used to paint a picture!

I created this repo just to hold onto notes and stuff for the game, I do not intend to start working on this in the short term.  The whole repository basically exists to hold onto this file for the time being.

The primary platform for the game is mobile.  It's based on touch-and-swipe gameplay and it's a game I'd like to play while sitting around waiting for meetings or cabs or whatever.  I am torn between doing it in Java (for android) for the experience and portfolio building; or doing it in JavaScript since I like it and it can move a little more easily between platforms.  I've pulled a few options to consider at some point.

**impact.js** http://impactjs.com/

**Lime.js** http://www.limejs.com/

**gameplay3d** http://www.gameplay3d.io/

**Unity3d** 
I do have a unity license and have seen it used for some good mobile games, might be worth exploring before I end my Unity3d subscription.

**Maoi** http://getmoai.com/
Uses Lua instead of JavaScript, but I've read that it's pretty great once you have it all set up.  Doesn't appear to have any desktop version, being entirely mobile but that's OK really.

**Corona SDK** https://coronalabs.com/
Another Lua framework, it looks much more mature than Maoi but still appears to lack desktop deployment.  Some successful games have been built using it and the documentation seems robust.  This is currently the frontrunner for my library of choice.
